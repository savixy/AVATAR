## About Joint Learning Lab 2023 - JLL 2023
The JLL (Joint Learning Lab) has been a week, inside the AVATAR Erasmus+ project, where students coming from university University of Belgrade, Grenoble INP and Politecnico faced challenges about VR/AR to understand the potentialities of those technologies.
## Welcoming and hosting

## Overall organisation of the joint learning lab 
During the JLL 3 main activities has been completed by the students. 

On Monday, after a brief introduction from professor Urgo they had the possibility to visit the VR Cave inside the MADE competence center to get in contact with VR/AR technologies. The afternoon was dedicated to introductory lecture.

Second and third days the students were involved in the solving of the challenges at STIIMA-CNR.

On thursday they had the possibility to visit the XR Laboratories at POLIMI and touch with hand visiors and applications.

The last day was dedicated to the completion of the final presentation and the relative exposition.
### Student challenge
Most of the students' time and effort was devoted to the solving of challenges on Tuesday and Wednesday.

The challenges were about working with robots inside the robotic laboratory in CNR. Virtual environment, robot trajectories and MQTT protocol were the main topics they got in contact with.

During those days they have been sided by Politecnico's students and tutors to overcame the most difficult obstacles.

### Welcome session: 
During the welcome session professor Urgo explained how the week would have been organized. Students had the possibility to start knowing themselves.

Students had the possibility to have a clear and complete view of MADE competence center in Politecnico di Milano (Candiani). In particular had possibility to touch and get in contasct with VR visors and augmented reality glasses. Moreover, all the robotics researches on course in the lab were showed to them to have a broad view about the possible robot applications.
### Introductory lecture:
The lecture on monday afternoon was about the...

### VR and Robotics lab at CNR:
Before starting working with the challenges, students visited the VR labs at STIIMA-CNR and the Robotic lab, the one it will have been later rrepresented in a virtual environment.

### Challenges:
On Tuesday afternoon the solving of the challenges officially started. 4 groups were created considering the different nationalities of the students to have the most various mix of skills and cultures.

The work on the challenges continued, for approximately one day and a half. During this time students also started to get ready for the final presentation.


### XR lab:
On Thurday, the students had the possibility to directly work with visors and Unity software. After getting in contact with some possible applications like the building of a robot, the trajectory visualization they worked to track their movements with a special camera and animate a 3D model in Unity environment.

### Groupwork to create the final presentation:
